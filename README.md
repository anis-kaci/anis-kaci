# Hello, I'm Anis Kaci

I'm a Junior Data scientist, data engineering student, athlete and a passionate data science enthusiast with a strong focus on Large Language Models and sports related use cases of AI , I also have a deep interest in mathematical concepts, particularly those closely related to data science, such as probability and statistics.

## About Me

- ðŸ“š Data Engineering Student
- ðŸ§  LLM Enthusiast
- ðŸ¤– GenAI Practitioner
- ðŸ“– Lifelong Learner
- ðŸ“Š Mathematics forever curious

## What I Do

I'm constantly exploring the fascinating world of data science and AI. My work involves:

- Large Language Models Theory (Architectures,BERT,GPT...etc)
- Research LLMs and AI use cases in Sports (Table Tennis)
- Building GenAI applications using LLMs
- Solving real-world business problems using data
- Exploring the beautiful world of mathematics and its role in data science


## What Im currently working on 
- Fine tuning LLM models for different purposes, using different techniques (DeepSeek, LoRA, QLoRA)
- GenAI for sentiment analysis (Speech-to-text, text-to-speech)
- Keep up with LLM most recent architectures and trends (DeepSeek, Agents..)
- Coding, exploring and understanding various Neural networks concepts
- Exploring, coding and testing ML and deep learning models for different fields use cases (Business, manufacturing, healthcare..etc)
